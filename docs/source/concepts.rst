Concepts
=========

We present some general concepts regarding blockchain technology, specifically regarding Neo2.


Shared PrivateNet
-----------------

This proposal is unique and powerful, in the sense that it expands local testing (called *PrivateNet*) to
a global scale (thus allowing interaction with other developers worldwide in real time).
It contrasts with the official *MainNet* in the sense that assets are not *real*, which is also the case
for the official *TestNet*. One difference from *TestNet* is that no *faucet* is required, since development
assets are refreshed from time to time (previously 12 hours, then 7 days), allowing quick and frequent upgrades from 
Neo core development branches (always with bleeding edge innovations) and high availability.
