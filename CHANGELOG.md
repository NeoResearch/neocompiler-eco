# Changelog
Welcome to NeoCompiler Eco project. This project is fully developed by the community using MIT License, so feel free to contribute with coding or even with good ideas or indication of bugs/issues. It is intended to included all compiling and testing support for developing smart contracts on NEO blockchain. We will hold an online version on neocompiler.io website, but you can also have it in your computer! We hope it's useful and we accept donations if you really enjoy it :)

Project was born on https://github.com/NeoResearch/neocompiler-eco.

### Versioning Guidelines
The idea is to follow the semantic versioning format for the releases (MAJOR-MINOR-FIX).
- The MAJOR will be attributed to major changes in interface (when the main concept is somehow changed) or main changes in the backend technologies (which may cause bigger incompatibility issues)
- The MINOR will be updated on improvements and new features (may cause some small incompatibilities, but the idea is to be fully compatible)
- The FIX number will be used when specific fixes are made on a previously launched release (but we intend to keep moving on the mainline, so do not be too much left behind :D)
