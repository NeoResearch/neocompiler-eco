This is an open-source initiative for providing an easy access to on NEO ecosystem.

In particular, we provide simple interact and didactic interfaces for allowing online compiling for C#, Python, Go and Java.

**Official Documentation on [ReadTheDocs](https://neocompiler-eco.readthedocs.io)**

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/neocompiler-eco/badge/?version=latest)](https://neocompiler-eco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

#### Building Sphinx Documentation Locally

Just type `./make-docs.sh`, and find `./docs/build/html/index.html` (the same as *ReadTheDocs*)

### Suggestions

#### Browsers/Devices

* Tested with Firefox Quantum - 84.0

#####  The current front-end interface can be acessed from:
* [https://neocompiler.io](https://neocompiler.io), automatically generated from the source code located in this current repository.

##### Compilers RPC API services are available at:

* [https://compilers-neo3.neocompiler.io/](https://compilers-neo3.neocompiler.io)

##### Other useful services

* [https://ecoservices-neo3.neocompiler.io](https://ecoservices-neo3.neocompiler.io)
* Shared privatenet with 4 consensus nodes as default;
* C# RPC node with watch-only CN feature;

### What does it currently do
* Compile input C# code using reliable and safe servers (backend) compilers;
* Return NEF compatible files: AVM, ABI and MANIFEST codes;
* Deploy and invoke code to private net, shared privatenet, testnet (unsafe), mainet (unsafe);
* Save your history of activies for testing a given smart contract;
* Tests with different wallets, synced and with able to provide historic data our activity;
* Perform all up-to-date blockchain invocations and RPC calls;
* Runs RPC with all enabled plugins and up-to-date features;
* Provide basic statistical data;
* Use websockets to provide some useful information;
* It can be used on TestNet, or even MainNet.

### Roadmap

* Move towards client-based compiling (more secure, robust and much more scalable).
* Ideas? Collaborations are welcome :) The goal is to be didactic and bring it close to citizens and users: Smart Cities, Smart Governance and Smart Blockchain Technologies :P

### Dependencies

### Docker recommendations

Docker technology is essential for sandboxing all compilers in different environments (for different languages).
Docker compose is now integrated with desktop docker.

* Ubuntu-based distributions [guidelines](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#set-up-the-repository):

`sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common`

`curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -`

`sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88`

`sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"`

`sudo apt update`

`sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io`

If necessary, add user to docker group: `sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER`

# Build everything

The online command required to create our own NeoCompiler Ecosystem, suitable for private of public blockchain projects.

This will call a docker-compose with NeoCompiler Private Net (Eco) + NeoScan (optional).
Furthermore, it will set all available compilers and open the front/backend interface and server, respectively.

`./build_everything.sh`

# Developers guidelines

Basically, two steps are required: A1 and A2.
Both are described below.

## A1) Building compilers

This script already builds the compilers and starts the server:

`./docker-sock-express-compilers/docker-compilers/buildCompilers.sh`

* Edit `./docker-sock-express-compilers/docker-compilers/.env` if you want to build other compilers, for example `BUILD_ALL_CSHARP=0`
  * Build list with different versions for a given compiler, such as: `docker-sock-express-compilers/docker-compilers/compilers/docker-compiler-csharp/docker_build_list_of_compilers.sh`

#### Building C# Neo Core Compiler entrypoint based image

The backend for C# is provided using native `github/neo-project` tools, only two steps are necessary to build and tag image:

`cd /docker-sock-express-compilers/docker-compilers/compilers/docker-compiler-csharp`

`docker_build.sh`

### Running express node servers


**Base images express nodes and dockers**

`docker-sock-express-compilers/docker-ubuntu-docker-node-express`

`./docker_build-all.sh` will build both:
* essential docker image for express and node `docker_build-express.sh`
* the aforementioned image with docker `docker_build-express-docker.sh`

**Http front-end**:
`cd /docker-sock-express-compilers/docker-http-express`

`docker compose up`

**Compilers RPC API Backend**:
`cd docker-sock-express-compilers/docker-compilers`

`docker compose up`

**Eco Services**:
`cd docker-sock-express-compilers/docker-services`

`docker compose up`

## A2) Eco Network Funtionalities

Docker compose is the main tools that acts for the creation of our micro-service.
This script will start all necessary backend functionalities and neo-csharp-nodes.

In particular, we currently have:

* csharp nodes are with TCP at 2033x and RPC at 3033X, websocket is not being used
  * 4 csharp consensus node, two of them are also a RPC as default at port 30333 and 30334;
  * 1 csharp pure RPC nodes at 30337;

### Dealing with docker compose swarm of containers

Start up the container, checking the messages and following warnings

Simply run `runEco_network.sh` (integrated with `.env` file)

or:

`cd ./docker-compose-eco-network`

```
docker compose up
```

Start up the container in a detached mode
```
docker compose up -d
```

Feel free to take is down
```
docker compose down
```

However, consider stopping and restarting
```
docker compose stop
docker compose start
```

### NeoCompiler Eco useful commands and ideas

#### Other functionalities and integrations are possible and some are implemented

It is also possible to integrate the Eco Network with lighwallet and explorers.

#### Other parameters

One could check docker docker-compose.yml, picking up a combination of your choice from `docker-compose-eco-network` folder.
This can be done for locally modifying some characteristics.

Run `build_everything.sh` with an additional parameter `--no-build` and your modified node `zip` of the private net will be called, use the name `neo-cli-built.zip`.


#### Useful Commands

# open csharpnodes

* `docker exec -it eco-neo-csharp-node1-running bash`
* `screen -dr` will show the screen
* `/opt/run.sh` will start a new screen (if you killed the last process);
* `/opt/start_node.sh` will start the node directly in the terminal.


## Contributing

* If you have ideas or issues, you can inform directly at github or contact us directly

  1. Check the open [issues](https://github.com/NeoResearch/neocompiler-eco/issues) and
[pull requests](https://github.com/NeoResearch/neocompiler-eco/pulls) for existing discussions.
  1. Open an issue first, to discuss a new feature or enhancement.
  1. Write tests, and make sure the test suite passes locally and on CI.
  1. Open a pull request, and reference the relevant issue(s).

  1. Anyway, you already were part of team... :P

* Our team is currently formed by researchers/professors, so our time is very constrained... if you feel you can help us, don't hesitate!
* We created a wallet specially for project donations. That can help us improve our servers and perhaps hire someone for improving graphical interfaces and developing many more interesting features. NEO wallet:
